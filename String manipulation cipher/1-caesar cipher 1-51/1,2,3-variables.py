# Variables can store values of different data types. You just assigned an integer value, but if you want to represent some text, you need to assign a string. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes, but you cannot start a string with a single quote and end it with a double quote or vice versa:

# string_1 = "I am a string"
# string_2 = 'I am also a string'
# string_3 = 'This is not valid"

# You can use the built-in function print() to print the output of your code on the terminal. Functions are reusable code blocks that you can call (run) when you need them. To call a function, you just need to write a pair of parentheses next to its name.
text = "hello world"
print(text)
