#variable = named place in the memory we can access it later - 
x = 12

#vars take the value of end statement-
x = 100
#friendly var names are always appreciated
a = 5

#mnemonic var names - 
hours = 35.9
rate = 12.5
pay = hours * rate
print(pay)

#assignment operator is used to assign values to variables (looks like =)
x = 0.63 
x = 3.68 * x * x * (1 - x)
#takes the value of x from previous line and does the whole maths, assigns result to x and so the result is new value of x
